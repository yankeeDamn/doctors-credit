      <h2>People already travel abroad for medical care</h2>
      <p>
        Patients in many countries already travel for planned care. One documented
        example is the United States, where CDC background material on medical
        tourism describes people traveling for lower cost, procedures not available
        at home, dental, fertility, cancer and cosmetic care. It also describes
        infection, continuity-of-care, post-return complications, insurance and
        legal-difference risks. Those motivations are not unique to one country.

      <h2>Coverage at home changes the math</h2>
      <p>
        A large hospital bill at home does not necessarily mean you pay that
        amount. Healthcare coverage or funding, remaining deductible where that
        applies, coinsurance, copay, out-of-pocket maximum, approved-provider
        rules and prior authorization decide what you may need to pay yourself.
        DCredit compares likely patient responsibility, not sticker prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The on-site calculator includes one plan-math example, the kind used where
        deductibles and out-of-pocket limits apply. That example is labeled as
        such. It does not describe every health system.
