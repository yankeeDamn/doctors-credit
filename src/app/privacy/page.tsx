      <h1>How we hold what you tell us.</h1>
      <p>
        DCredit is an international planned-care decision and coordination
        platform, not a hospital or diagnostic service. The $5 Initial
        Assessment collects operational details a coordinator needs: name,
        email, phone, location, procedure category, healthcare coverage or
        funding status and timeline. It is not a medical-record intake.
      </p>
      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>
        New Initial Patient Assessment sandbox payments use Cashfree. We provide
        billing contact details to the gateway and retain order references,
        payment attempts, verified amounts and currencies for your account.
        We do not collect card numbers or CVV. Historical $5 Dodo records remain
        separate. New assessment payments are not sent to the legacy Sheets or
        meeting-creation workflow. Live payments and revised refund terms remain pending.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google sign-in (name and email), the $5 Initial Assessment payment
        processed by Dodo Payments (we never store card numbers, CVV or banking
        passwords), application status, and messages you send. Payment is marked
        paid only after Dodo confirms it on the server. Operational fields may
        be copied to a private Google Sheet used as a temporary CRM. That sheet
        is not public and is not a healthcare database. We do not store full
        medical history, imaging, prescriptions or detailed diagnoses there.
      </p>
      <h2>What we do not provide in V1</h2>
      <p>
        DCredit does not currently operate a medical-record vault, secure
        document-upload service, or account-gated clinical files. Please do not
        send MRI scans, CT scans, prescriptions, diagnoses or other sensitive
        clinical documents through this website, the contact form or WhatsApp.
      </p>
      <h2>Healthcare privacy laws</h2>
      <p>
        Health-privacy rules differ by country. This website does not claim
        compliance with any one of them. For example, in the United States we
        do not claim HIPAA compliance. We do not claim a medical-record
        security program that is not in place.
      </p>
      <h2>Your file</h2>
      <p>
        After payment is confirmed you receive an Application ID and a
        Conversation Verification ID. Those identifiers are for genuine DCredit
        communication. They are not passwords, OTPs or banking PINs. Ask us to
        close the file and we will stop using it for coordination.
