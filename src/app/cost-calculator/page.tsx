      <h1>Compare the total cost of the journey.</h1>
      <p>
        Cost is part of the decision, not the entire decision. A hospital price
        at home is not what you pay. An India quote is not the journey. The
        meaningful comparison includes expected healthcare costs at home,
        expected treatment cost in India, travel, accommodation, companion
        costs, time away, recovery and possible follow-up.
      </p>
      <p>
        The comparison is for patients wherever they live. When a plan uses
        deductibles and an out-of-pocket limit, the calculator can show that
        style of math. It is one example, not a model of every health system.
        Sometimes India may offer strong value. Sometimes it may not. Potential
        savings are not guaranteed. This calculator is an estimate only, not a
        quote, not insurance verification and not medical advice.
